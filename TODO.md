# Interactive Map with Filtered Locations - Implementation Plan

## Current Status: âœ… In Progress

### âœ… Completed Steps:
1. Analysis of existing codebase and requirements
2. Plan creation and user approval

### ðŸ”„ In Progress:
3. Create location data structure and mock data
4. Enhance GISMap component with filtering and markers
5. Update Index.tsx to pass data and filters

### ðŸ“‹ Remaining Steps:
1. Add location data structure to tamilNaduBoundary.ts
2. Generate mock location data with realistic coordinates
3. Enhance GISMap component with:
   - Location filtering logic
   - Marker creation with tooltips
   - Auto-center and zoom functionality
   - Performance optimizations
   - Different marker colors for crop types
4. Update Index.tsx to pass location data and filters
5. Test functionality with different filter combinations

## Implementation Details:
- Location interface with lat, lng, cropType, season, soilType, fertility, npk, ndvi
- Mock data: 500-1000 locations within Tamil Nadu boundary
- Marker clustering for performance
- Dynamic filtering based on SimpleFilterPanel criteria
- Color-coded markers by crop type/fertility level
